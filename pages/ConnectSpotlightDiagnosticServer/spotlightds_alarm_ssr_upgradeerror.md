If in your environment the Spotlight Statistics Repository is replicated as per a Microsoft Replication database the upgrade can fail if schema changes are required that can only be made when replication is turned off. To successfully upgrade the Spotlight Statistics Repository, the steps are to: turn replication off, upgrade the Spotlight Diagnostic Server, then re-enable replication.
