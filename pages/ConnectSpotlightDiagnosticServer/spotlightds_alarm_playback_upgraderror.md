For details of the alarm, see <xref href="spotlight:AlarmLog.AlarmLogCurrent" format="html" scope="external">Spotlight Today</xref>.

If in your environment the Playback Database is replicated as per a Microsoft Replication database the upgrade can fail if schema changes are required that can only be made when replication is turned off. To successfully upgrade the Playback Database, the steps are to: turn replication off, upgrade the Spotlight Diagnostic Server, then re-enable replication.
