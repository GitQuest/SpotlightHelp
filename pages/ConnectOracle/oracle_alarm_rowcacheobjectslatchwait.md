Causes of contention:

* High rates of DDL associated with the recursive SQL that maintains internal Oracle information such as space management and undo management.
* Other potential causes are many and varied. Track down the root cause of the problem by identifying the SQL concerned or the areas of the row cache associated with the contention.
