Lock waits can occur for a number of reasons, sometimes including internal database contention. However, the most common category of locks are those taken out on table rows or index entries during an update, insert, or delete.

For more information about the locks on the system, see the Blocking Locks page in the Activity drilldown. For more information about reducing lock overhead, see the help topic Reducing lock contention.
