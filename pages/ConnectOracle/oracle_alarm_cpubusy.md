To determine where excessive amounts of CPU are being used, you can use:

* The server’s operating system tool, such as **top** on Unix or **Task Manager** on Windows, to find out which processes use the most CPU.
* The Top Sessions drilldown to find out if a particular session is using CPU excessively.
* The SQL & Application Workload drilldown to find out which SQL uses a lot of CPU.
