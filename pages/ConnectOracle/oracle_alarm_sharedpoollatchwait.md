The primary cause of contention is excessive hard parsing. This can indicate the need to use bind variables or adjust the **CURSOR_SHARING** parameter.

To combat shared pool fragmentation:

* Flush the shared pool periodically using the **ALTER SYSTEM FLUSH SHARED POOL** command.
* Set a minimum value for the shared pool if you are using automatic SGA memory management. Alternatively, revert to manual memory management.
* Use **DBMS_SHARED_POOL** to prevent large objects from moving in and out of memory.
