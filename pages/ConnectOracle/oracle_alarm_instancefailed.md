* The reported error message may help to resolve the issue.
* View the Disk Storage \| Archive Destinations Page for more information.

An instance failure occurs during archiving when:

* A MANDATORY archive destination fails, OR
* There are now fewer working destinations than the number required for successful archiving (specified by the Oracle LOG_ARCHIVE_MIN_SUCCEED_DEST parameter).
