<p>Possible things to consider:</p>

  <p><b>VMware Server address</b></p>
<p>The VMware Server address is entered on the VMware Server | Connection Details screen. Click Configure | Connections and select the VMware connection type; right click on the connection and select Properties.</p>
<p>Check the address is a valid IP address or hostname of the ESX server or VirtualCenter server.</p>
<p>If you have a VirtualCenter server then connect to that in preference to the ESX host. That way if the virtual machine migrates from one host to another the VirtualCenter server can still be interrogated for data for the virtual machine.</p>

  <p><b>Authentication</b></p>
  <p>Authentication to the VMware Server is defined on the VMware Server | Connection Details screen. Click Configure | Connections and select the VMware connection type; right click on the connection and select Properties.</p>
  <p>Verify the user has at least a read-only role for the ESX server or VirtualCenter server.</p>
  <p><b>VMware Server availability</b></p>
  <p>Verify the VMware Server is available and accessible over the network. Verify TCP port 135 is open</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The alarm will clear automatically if the error is due to the service being down or network problems and the error condition goes away.</p>


* Check the connection to the service.
* Check the availability of the service.
* Check the network.

If WMI queries fail then a Windows Connection Failure alarm is raised on the third successive failed attempt, not on every failed attempt.
