Possible things to consider:

## SQL Azure connection details

The SQL Azure connection details are entered on the SQL Azure \| Connection Details screen. Click Configure \| Connections and select the SQL Azure connection type; right click on the connection and select Properties.

Spotlight uses the connection details to connect to the SQL Azure database. Verify they are correct. Verify the address is valid and in the form of a URL. Verify the name of the database as entered exists. Verify the user and password as entered are correct.

## SQL Azure availability

Verify the SQL Azure database is available and accessible to the Spotlight Diagnostic Server.
