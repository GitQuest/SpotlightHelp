Data components are broken down into space used by:

* Data Used
* Data Free (not allocated to any tables/indexes)

The maximum database size is determined by the edition of the SQL Azure database.

{% include tip.html content="Use the Database Space list at the top of the chart to display the size in **megabytes** (MB) or as **percentages** of the amount of space taken." %}
