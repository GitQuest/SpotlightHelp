If the file system fills up completely, no more data can be written to it. For example:

* If the /var file system fills, you may have problems with system activities such as e-mail or printing.
* If the /home file system fills, user applications may be affected.
* If the /tmp file system fills, any applications that use temporary files may be affected.
