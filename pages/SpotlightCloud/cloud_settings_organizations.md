## Share your Spotlight data with your whole team

It is now possible for you to sign in and create an organization in Spotlight that your whole team can join. You simply create the organization and invite others to join and share their monitoring and analysis data with you.

Until now if your team each had their own separate Spotlight accounts you couldnâ€™t easily share your monitoring and performance data with them, but now you can.

## Share data with team members on both web and mobile platforms
