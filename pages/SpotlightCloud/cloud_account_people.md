## About the People Page
The table in the middle of the screen lists the email addresses of each of the members of the organization and either the date they joined or their invitation status.

Invitation status | Description
-------|------------
Pending Invite | An invitation has been sent to this email address so they may join the organization. The invitation has not yet been accepted.
Invitation Expired | The invitation has expired. The invitation is valid for 48 hours from the time it is sent. Click the button to resend the invite.

{% include tip.html content="If your organization has many members then use the search facility at the top of the page to search the email addresses for matching text." %}

## Invite a new member to join the organization

1. From the People page, click **Invite Member**.
2. This opens a dialog for you to enter the email addresses of people you wish to invite. When entering multiple email addresses, separate each address with a comma.
