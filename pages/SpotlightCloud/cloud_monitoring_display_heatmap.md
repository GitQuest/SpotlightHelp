summary: "The Heat Map display organizes connections based on the comparative number and severity of alarms raised against them. Connections with the most alarms raised against them are given the most surface area on the heat map. The heatmap refreshes itself automatically when connections are added and removed and when there is a change in the alarm status. Connections are removed from the heat map when monitoring is disabled and while they are in planned outage. The Heat Map answers the question: Which monitored connections require the most urgent attention?"
