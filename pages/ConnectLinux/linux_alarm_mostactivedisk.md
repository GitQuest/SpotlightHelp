tags: [linux_alarms]
last_updated: July 29, 2016
summary: "The Most Active Disk alarm is triggered when the read/write rate of the most active disk exceeds a specified threshold. A disk that is more than 20% busy (according to Sun Performance and Tuning by A. Cockroft) should be investigated, and possibly have data on it split up and moved to different disks."
