last_updated: July 29, 2016
summary: "The Zombie button in the CPU panel shows the number of terminated child processes that have not been acknowledged by their parent process. A high level of zombie processes is indicative of the presence of an inferior program, or an entry in /etc/inittab (or equivalent) preventing init from completing its startup sequence."
