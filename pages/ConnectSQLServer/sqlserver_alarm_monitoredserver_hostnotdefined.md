The Monitored Server - SQL Server Host Not Defined Alarm is raised for:

* A Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS)
* Where the SQL Server Connection Details dialog Connection field is set to Cluster (monitor active node).
* And the active cluster node is NOT in the list of available OS connections in the SQL Server Connection Details dialog Linked OS Connection drop down field.


For a SQL Server cluster that uses the Cluster (monitor active node) feature there must be a Windows connection for each Windows node in the cluster. For more information, see SQL Server \| Connection Details. This alarm clears once the Windows connection has been created.
