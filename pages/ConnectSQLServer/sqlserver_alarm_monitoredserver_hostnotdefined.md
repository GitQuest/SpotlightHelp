The **Monitored Server - SQL Server host not defined** alarm is raised for:

1. A Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS)
2. Where the **SQL Server Connection Details** dialog **Connection** field is set to **Cluster (monitor active node)**.
3. And the active cluster node is NOT in the list of available OS connections in the **SQL Server Connection Details** dialog **Linked OS Connection** drop down field.

For a SQL Server cluster that uses the Cluster (monitor active node) feature there must be a Windows connection for each Windows node in the cluster. See the online help **Spotlight \| Spotlight on SQL Server \| Connections to SQL Servers** page for more information. This alarm  clears once the Windows connection has been created.
