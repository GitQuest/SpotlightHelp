When the alarm is raised

This database is spending too much time waiting for bottlenecks such as locks and latches. Note that this alarm uses a score averaged over 30 minutes to smooth out any rapid movement.

For more information on your database's performance health see the SQL Server \| Performance Health Drilldown.

A performance-health rating of 80% or more is considered healthy. For more information, see SQL Server \| Home Page \| Performance Health Panel.
