There are two version stores in Tempdb. The online index build version store is used for online index builds in all databases. The common version store is used for all other data modification operations in all databases.

This chart occupies the same space as the Tempdb Version Store Size Change chart. Alternate between the charts via the drop down menu in the chart title.

The Version Store chart is populated using SQLTempDBPerfCounters.
