Spotlight calculates the number of times the file group could grow before hitting the defined limits.

This alarm is ignored if **Auto Grow=No** for all files in the file group. The growths remaining is set to null.

## While this alarm is current
Open the SQL Server \| Databases Drilldown \| Data Files page. In the Data Files grid, check for files with **Auto Grow=Yes**. Files in danger of filling will have a low **Free Pct** figure.

## To resolve this problem
Free up disk space on the disk that the file resides on.

## Spotlight alarm configuration
In Spotlight Enterprise from the Spotlight Client you can configure this alarm to ignore certain values.
