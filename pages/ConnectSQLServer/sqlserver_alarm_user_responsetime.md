This is not an error. Spotlight is just saying that it is taking over 20 seconds (or the configured threshold) to execute the response time query in your environment. This could be indicative of:

* Response time SQL blocking (Check the configured Response Time SQL)
* A network issue between the Spotlight Diagnostic Server and the monitored SQL server(s)
* A problem with the monitored SQL Server(s)

You may want to find out what the Response Time SQL is (default "select 1") and execute that SQL from SQL Server Management Studio from the Spotlight Diagnostic Server host against one of the monitored SQL Servers exhibiting the issue.

## Configuration

The Response Time SQL is a user defined T-SQL batch that can be used to indicate application response time.

Note: Membership of the Spotlight diagnostic administrators group is required to change the SQL Statement used to measure SQL Server response time. For more information, see Spotlight diagnostic user groups.
