## Tips to using this grid

* Click a session in the grid for more details on the session.
* Many applications create multiple connections to SQL Server.
* When there are more than 2000 sessions only those sessions that are active (and those sessions that are blocked and blocking)Â are shown.
* To show only those sessions that are currently executing, click **Show active sessions only**.
* To close a SQL Server session, right click and select **Kill this session**. This option is available only to members of the Spotlight Diagnostic Administrators group.

## General tips to using Spotlight grids

* Some columns may be hidden by default. Right-click the grid headings and select the columns to show.
* To filter the data displayed in this grid to restrict displays to a manageable or relevant set of data, right-click the grid and select **View/Edit Filter**.
* To find a particular session, right-click and choose **Find**.
