## Tips to this grid

* Many applications create multiple connections to SQL Server.
* When there are more than 2000 sessions only those sessions that are active (and those sessions that are blocked and blocking)Â are shown.
* In SQL Server 2005 and 2008, to show only those sessions that are currently executing, click **Show active sessions only**.
* In SQL Server 2000, clicking **Show active sessions only** shows sessions that:
   * Do not have a status of sleeping, background or dormant.
   * Are blocked.
   * Have a command type of "WAITFOR".
* To close a SQL Server session, right click and select **Kill this session**. This option is available only to members of the Spotlight Diagnostic Administrators group.  To select multiple sessions use the shortcut key combinations CTRL+click or SHIFT+click.
* Click a session in the grid for more details on the session.

## The columns of the grid include:

### SPID

Number that SQL Server has assigned to uniquely identify the selected session.

### Reads

Number of physical reads performed for each request.  It shows no data for SQL Server 2000.

### Writes

Number of physical writes performed for each request.  It shows no data for SQL Server 2000.

### Last Wait Type

Describes the type of wait that this session last waited on (or is currently waiting on).

### Net Library

Network protocol being used to establish communication between SQL Server and the application.
