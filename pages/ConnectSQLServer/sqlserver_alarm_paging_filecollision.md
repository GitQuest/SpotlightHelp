This can cause performance degradation â€“ especially on IDE disks. IDE disks allow only a single disk operation to be active on the bus at any time.

To rectify this:

1. Open the Windows Control Panel.
2. Double-click **System**.
3. Click the **Advanced tab**.
4. Select **Performance Settings**, and change the paging file allocations.
