The **Databases - Dynamic Data File Group Growths Remaining** and **Databases - Data File Group Space Used** alarms are raised when the space allocated to a disk group is about to run out.

This **Databases - Data File Group About to Grow** alarm is raised before a file is about to grow so you can ensure the time the file resizes is suitable; for example at a time of off-peak activity. It is based on a ratio between FixedDataUsed and TotalDB calculated on the FileGroup procedure.
