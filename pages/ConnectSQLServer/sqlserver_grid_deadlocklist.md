Select an item in the list to see information about the deadlock in XML. From here you can view a graphical representation of the deadlock in SQL Server Management Studio (if installed), by clicking **Open in Management Studio**.

<note type="note">The best way to see deadlocks in Spotlight is to use the History Browser to view
the Deadlocks list at the time the deadlock occurred. As SQL Server resolves deadlocks
quickly, they appear for only a short time when Spotlight is in live mode.</note>
