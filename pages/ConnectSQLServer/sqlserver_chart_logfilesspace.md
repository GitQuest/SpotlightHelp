The chart values can be displayed in megabytes or as a percentage of disk space. Use the Log File Space list to change the values displayed on the chart.

The log files displayed can be restricted by clicking the **database(s)** of interest in the Databases grid. They can then be further restricted by clicking just the **log files** of interest in the Log Files grid. Hold down the **Shift** key to select a block of multiple records or the **CTRL** key to select individual records.
