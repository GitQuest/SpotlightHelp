The transaction logs displayed can be restricted by clicking the **database(s)** of interest in the Databases grid. They can then be further restricted by clicking just the **transaction logs** of interest in the Transaction Logs grid. Hold down the **Shift** key to select a block of multiple records, or the **CTRL** key to select individual records.
