Use the Growth list to change the values displayed on the chart. You can display the **File Used MB** or the **File Total MB**.

The files displayed can be restricted by clicking the **database(s)** of interest in the Databases grid at the top of the drilldown. They can then be further restricted by clicking just the **files** of interest in the Data Files grid. Hold down the **Shift** key to select multiple databases or the **CTRL** key to select individual records.
