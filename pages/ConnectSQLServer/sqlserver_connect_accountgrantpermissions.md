title: Grant account permissions
last_updated: July 29, 2016
summary: "Spotlight connects to the SQL Server instance using the authentication defined by SQL Server | Connection Details. Spotlight requires necessary account permissions to connect to the SQL Server instance. Typically the account will be a member of the sysadmin server role. It could be a SQL Server login (such as 'sa'). It could be the Windows account that runs the Spotlight Diagnostic Server provided that account is trusted by the SQL Server."

In some environments the above may not be feasible. The following instructions are provided for these environments. Run the following SQL script (as sysadmin) to grant the required permissions to user **TrustedUser**. Note the comment lines at the end of the script and un-comment as appropriate for your environment.

## Known issues with this script

### No data on the SQL Server \| Support Services Drilldown \| Service Status page  

This script does not grant sufficient privileges to view the data on this page.

### Error: The SQL Server Agent service status cannot be determined because a registry key cannot be read due to lack of permission.

The script QS_Services.sql can be executed successfully only under login with SQL Server sysadmin rights. If the script QS_Services.sql is executed without a sysadmin account the above error will be raised.
