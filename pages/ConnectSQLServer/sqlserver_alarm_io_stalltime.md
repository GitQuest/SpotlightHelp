Sustained high I/O wait times are a good indicator that you have a disk subsystem bottleneck and that I/O device service times will be degraded.

## When the alarm is raised

Look at the SQL Server \| Wait Events drilldown \| IO Category to see what is contributing to I/O consumption. If SQL Server is contributing to I/O consumption look at the following:

* The I/O by File page on the SQL Server \| SQL Activity drilldown to see which files are waiting on I/O operations. High rates of wait on log files may indicate that the device on which the log file resides is not able to keep up.
* The Sessions page on the SQL Server \| SQL Activity drilldown to see which SQL Server sessions are generating high amounts of disk activity. The SQL and the query plan are available for further analysis by clicking a row in the grid.
* The SQL Server \| Wait Statistics Drilldown. Looking at the top statements by Avg Logical Reads/Writes shows SQL that may be doing large amounts of logical I/O. This logical I/O may result in unnecessary physical I/O.

## Configuration

You can configure this alarm to ignore certain values. For more information, see Do not alarm for certain values.
