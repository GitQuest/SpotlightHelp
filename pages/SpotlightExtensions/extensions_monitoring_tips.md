## If 3 users all install the Spotlight Developer, will data be captured 3 times?
You can share a Diagnostic Server with other users and in doing so you will only capture data once. To share a Diagnostic Server open SQL Server Management Studio and go to "Settings" in the "Spotlight" menu and select "Diagnostic Server Configuration". You can then enter the address of the Diagnostic Server you wish to share.
