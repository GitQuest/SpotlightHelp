## Sign in with Spotlight Cloud credentials
This dialog opens the first time you attempt to monitor connections in Spotlight Extensions. After you fill in your Spotlight Cloud credentials you will be able to monitor connections in SPotlight Extensions and upload data via the Spotlight Diagnostic Server to the Spotlight Cloud where it can be viewed on the Spotlight web site or Spotlight Mobile.


## How do I get Spotlight Cloud credentials?
Create a Spotlight Cloud account if you do not already have one. Do this at the [Spotlight web site](https://www.spotlightessentials.com/home/SignUp).
