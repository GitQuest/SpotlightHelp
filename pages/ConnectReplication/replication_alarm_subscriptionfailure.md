When this alarm occurs, turn to the **Activity drilldown \| Subscriptions page** to see which subscription failed.

Look at the history of the agent involved:

1. From the **Activity drilldown \| Subscription page**, select the affected subscription.
2. Both sub-pages, Publisher \| Distributor and Distributor \| Subscriber, contain a Sessions grid.
3. Select a session in either of these grids, to see the information and error messages logged for that session.
