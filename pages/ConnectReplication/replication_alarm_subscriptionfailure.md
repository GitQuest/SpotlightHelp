## When this alarm occurs:

1. Look at the Subscriptions grid on the Subscriptions page of the Activity drilldown to see which subscription failed.
2. Look at the history of the agent involved. To do this:

   1. Go to the Subscriptions grid on the Subscriptions page in the Activity drilldown.
   2. Select the affected subscription. Both sub-pages, Publisher \| Distributor and Distributor \| Subscriber, contain a Sessions grid.
   3. Select a session in either of these grids, to see the information and error messages logged for that session.
