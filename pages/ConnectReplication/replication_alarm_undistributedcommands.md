Undistributed commands are commands in the distribution database that have not been delivered to the selected subscriber.

Look at the history of the affected subscription. To do this:

1. Go to the Subscriptions grid on the Subscriptions page in the Activity drilldown.
2. Select the affected subscription.
3. In the Sessions of the Log Reader Agent grid, select a session. The informational and error messages logged for that session are shown in the Top 200 Actions grid.
