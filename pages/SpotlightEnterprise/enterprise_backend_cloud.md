The Spotlight Diagnostic Server must be configured to allow upload of data to the Spotlight Cloud.

1. Ensure the Spotlight Diagnostic Server can access the Internet. For more information, see Spotlight services requiring Internet access.
2. Create a Spotlight Cloud account if you do not already have one. Go to www.spotlightessentials.com. Note that the Spotlight Cloud was previously called Spotlight Essentials - you can sign in with a Spotlight Essentials account.
3. Use a Spotlight Client to Configure uploading to Spotlight Cloud. Data is uploaded from the Spotlight Diagnostic Server to the Spotlight Cloud.

TIP: In a corporate enterprise your Spotlight Cloud account may receive a request to join an organization. In an organization, performance analysis data is uploaded to the organization and is available to all members of the organization. Members of the organization see a combined heat map and alarms list.
