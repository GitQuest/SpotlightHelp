## Before you can monitor Spotlight connections from Spotlight Mobile

Spotlight Mobile accesses data uploaded to the Spotlight Cloud from the Spotlight Diagnostic Server. In order for this process to work the Spotlight Diagnostic Server requires access to the Internet and must be configured to upload data to the Spotlight Cloud.

1. Create a Spotlight Cloud (Spotlight Essentials) account if you do not already have one. Do this at www.spotlightessentials.com.
2. Use a Spotlight Client to Configure uploading to Spotlight Cloud.
3. Download and Install Spotlight Mobile from www.spotlightessentials.com.
4. Sign in to Spotlight Mobile with your Spotlight Cloud account. If you have many Spotlight Cloud accounts then each can be added to Spotlight Mobile.
5. You may be given the opportunity to decline to receive push notifications from Spotlight on this mobile device. For information on push notifications, see Push notifications. For information on the receipt of these push notifications, refer to the Spotlight Mobile User Guide.
