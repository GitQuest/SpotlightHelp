* Some collections cannot be scheduled for reporting. They may gather too much data or there may be no value in the data for the purpose of reporting. Other collections are only collected for reporting so cannot be scheduled to run in the background.
* The background and reporting schedules for some collections cannot be modified.
* Real time schedules are used to view data live on the Spotlight Overview page or drilldowns. Real time schedules cannot be modified.
