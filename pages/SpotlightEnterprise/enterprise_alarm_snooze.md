Snoozed alarms are not included in the overall severity for a connection.

Snoozed alarms are identified by:

{% include imageClient.html file="icon_snooze.png" alt="snooze component" %}

When snoozing or unsnoozing an alarm there may be a short delay before the snooze or unsnooze takes affect.

When viewing historical data (via [Playback][enterprise_display_playback]), [Spotlight Overview pages][enterprise_display_overview] do not show snoozed alarms.

Snoozed alarms do not perform any associated [Alarm Actions][enterprise_cfgmonitor_alarmactions] (such as send notification emails).

To remove snoozed alarms from the [Alarm log][enterprise_display_alarmlog], select {% include inline_imageClient.html file="tb_action_changefilter.png" alt="Hide Snoozed Alarms" %} **Hide Snoozed Alarms**.
