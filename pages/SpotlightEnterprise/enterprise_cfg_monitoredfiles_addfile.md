2. In the **File Name** box, enter the pathname of the file whose growth you want to track.
3. In the **Max Allowed File Size** box, enter the maximum file size to which the file is permitted to grow before Spotlight raises an alarm. (Note that setting this value does NOT prevent the file from growing beyond that size.) 

 Note: You cannot change the value of **Current File Size**.
