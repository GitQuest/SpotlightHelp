If the Spotlight Diagnostic Server is federated you will be prompted to select the Spotlight Diagnostic Server to configure. Please configure each Spotlight Diagnostic Server in the federation (one at a time) independent of each other. You can direct each Spotlight Diagnostic Server to store data in the same Spotlight Statistics Repository (so one Spotlight Statistics Repository for the whole federation), but you don't have to.
