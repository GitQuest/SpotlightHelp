A Spotlight chart may contain multiple graphs representing separate data series from multiple data sources. You can filter the chart so that it shows only the data series that you want to see.

Spotlight supplies a set of filters that you can use ([Filter on the data series][enterprise_display_chartstoolbar.html#filteronadataseries]), but if none of the standard filters are suitable for your chart, you can design a custom filter.
