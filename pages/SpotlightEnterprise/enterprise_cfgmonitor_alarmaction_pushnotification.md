The standard scenario may be:

How can this rule be created and maintained in the Alarm Action Editor?

## Variable conditions - multiple rules

For any given rule, all the actions are taken when all the conditions are met. Any variability requires separate rules.

Push notifications for operating system related alarms and SQL Server related alarms may have different recipients.

{% raw %}
```
For all alarms
where the connection type is one of os/vmware, os/windows
   send Push Notification to helpdesk@company com

For all alarms
where the connection type is database/sqlserver
   send Push Notification to dbagroup@company com
```
{% endraw %}

The severity may determine the action.

{% raw %}
```
For all alarms
where the connection type is one of os/vmware, os/windows
      and the alarm severity is High
   send Push Notification to helpdesk@company com

For all alarms
where the connection type is database/sqlserver
      and the alarm severity is Medium or High
   send Push Notification to dbagroup@company com
```
{% endraw %}

## Send a Push Notification Dialog

Configure Spotlight to send a push notification to a mobile device when an alarm is raised.

### Open this dialog from the Spotlight Client

1. Click [Configure \| Alarms Actions][enterprise_cfgmonitor_alarmactions].
2. Click **New** to create a new rule. This opens the [Alarm Action Dialog][enterprise_cfgmonitor_alarmaction].

  1. Give a meaningful name to the rule.
  2. Select the conditions under which the rule will run.
  3. Under actions select **Send push notification to my mobile device**.


### Fill in the Send a Push Notification dialog

#### To

The Spotlight Cloud (Spotlight Essentials) account name(s) to receive the push notification.

Note that Spotlight Cloud account names are in the form of an email address. However the push notification is not sent to the email address. The push notification is sent to mobile device(s) where Spotlight Mobile is installed with Sign in from this(these) Spotlight Cloud account(s).

When multiple Spotlight Cloud account names are involved, separate each account name with a comma.

In the case of a Spotlight Cloud (Spotlight Essentials) organization, to send a push notification to all members of the organization, list all members of the organization in the To field.

#### Message

The push notification message.

This can include variables. For more information, see [Alarms - Message Variables][enterprise_cfgmonitor_alarm_messagevariables].

#### Test

Click **Test** to send a push notification to mobile device(s) where Spotlight Mobile is installed with Sign in from this(these) Spotlight Cloud account(s). Confirm notifications are working as expected.
