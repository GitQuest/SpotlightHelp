## Requirements
Microsoft Windows Powershell 3.0 or above is required. Older operating systems (for example Windows Server 2008 R2) require an upgrade of the Windows Management Framework in order to access Spotlight from the command line. [Download Windows Management Framework 3.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34595)

Where user / password details are required ensure the user us a member of the [Spotlight Diagnostic User Groups](enterprise_backend_spotlightdiagnosticusergroups) **Spotlight Diagnostic Administrators** or **Spotlight Diagnostic Users**. Where there are multiple Spotlight Diagnostic Servers in a [federation](enterprise_backend_federation) the user is required to be a member of the Spotlight Diagnostic User Groups for all Spotlight Diagnostic Servers in the federation.

## 1. Access Spotlight from Windows Powershell / the command line

From Windows Powershell, enter command: **Import-DS | Add-DS -PassThru**.

{% include tip.html content="Enter command **get-dS** to verify the Spotlight Diagnostic Server has been imported correctly. Get-DS will show imported Spotlight Diagnostic Server addresses." %}

{% include tip.html content="In some special situations or for some platforms, if **Import-DS** does not work for you then open the **Console** directory in the Spotlight Client installation directory (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Quest Software\Spotlight Enterprise). Right click the file **ds-cli.cmd** and select **Open** to open the command prompt." %}


## 2. Command Spotlight from Windows Powershell / the command line

* Basic commands
* Windows Powershell / Command line parameters
* Add a list of connections
* Remove many connections

## Basic commands

### List Spotlight connections

```
Get-Connection
```


### Delete a Spotlight connection

See also [Remove many connections](#RemoveManyConnections).

```
Remove-Connection -Name connectionName -PassThru
```



### Add a Spotlight connection

#### Windows authentication (using Diagnostic Server credentials)

See also [Add a list of connections](#AddAListOfConnections).

```
Add-Connection -Address address -Technology connectionType -Enabled -PassThru
```

#### Supply User / Password details

See also [Add a list of connections](#AddAListOfConnections).

```
Add-Connection -Credential $(get-credential) -Address address -Technology connectionType -Enabled -PassThru
```



### Change the authentication used to monitor a Spotlight connection

#### Supply User / Password details

```
Get-Connection -Name connectionName | Set-Connection -Credential $(get-credential)
```

#### Change to Windows authentication (using Diagnostic Server credentials)

```
Get-Connection -Name connectionName | Set-Connection -UseDSAuth
```


### Disable monitoring a Spotlight connection

```
Get-Connection -Name connectionName | Set-Connection -Disabled
```

### Re-enable monitoring a Spotlight connection

```
Get-Connection -Name connectionName | Set-Connection -Enabled
```

## Windows Powershell / Command line parameters

### -Name connectionName

Supply the name of the connection.

{% include note.html content="The connection name is not user-assignable. When executing Add-Connection from the command line, the connection name will take the form of the address followed by the connection type, as in address_connectionType" %}

Connection names are not case sensitive.

{% include tip.html content="A list of connection names can be summarized by wildcards * and ? as per prefix* or \*infix\* or on?char." %}

### -Address address

Supply the address of the Spotlight connection as per the form of the address entered in the **Spotlight Client \| Configure Connections \| Properties \| Details \| Address field**. For example: the Server Name, Server Instance Name, or IP address.

### -Technology connectionType

Supply the connection type in Internet MIME format. For example: os/windows, os/vmware. More free form forms are accepted such as windows, vmware, hyperv, sqlserver, sqlazure, analysisservices, replication and availabilitygroups.

### -Credential $(get-credential)

Use the -Credential parameter to specify User / Password details as per the connection type. For Add-Connection, where the -Credential parameter is not specified, Windows authentication (using Diagnostic Server credentials) is assumed.

The -Credential parameter requires a PSCredential object, which is a Powershell built-in object.

It can be used via a temporary variable (preferable if you want to add many connections) as per:

```
$c = $(get-credential)

Add-Connection -Credential $c -Technology sqlserver -Address my.host.name\instance -Enable
```

It can be used inline as per:

```
Add-Connection -Credential $(get-credential) -Technology sqlserver -Address my.host.name\instance -Enable
```

### -Enabled

Enable Spotlight monitoring on this connection.


### -Disabled


Disable Spotlight monitoring on this connection.


## Add a list of connections {#AddAListOfConnections}

Add a list of connections where all connections are of the same technology / connection type. Separate each address with a comma. Supply one technology type.

```
Add-Connection -Address address1,address2,address3 -Technology connectionType -Enabled -PassThru
```

Add a list of connections where there are varying connection types. Separate each address with a comma. Provide a list of technology types where the first address corresponds to the first technology type, the second address corresponds to the second technology type etc.

```
Add-Connection -Address address1,address2,address3 -Technology connectionType1,connectionType2,connectionType3 -Enabled -PassThru
```


## Remove many connections {#RemoveManyConnections}

Remove all connections

```
Remove-Connection -Name *
```


Remove all connections of a specific type (technology)

```
Remove-Connection -Technology connectionType
```

For example to remove all connections where the connection type is SQL Server:

```
Remove-Connection -Technology sqlserver
```

Remove a list of connections. Type the name of each connection. Separate each connection name with a comma.

```
Remove-Connection -Name connectionName1,connectionName2,connectionName3
```

Remove a list of connections where the connection names form a pattern.

```
Remove-Connection -Name connectionName*
```

For example to remove all connections where the name begins with the characters "address":

```
Remove-Connection -Name address*
```
