## General Enhancements

Known Issue | Issue ID
------------|---------
Enhancement to the handling of new versions of monitored systems. When the monitored system is newer than the versions Spotlight has been tested against (for connection types Windows, Hyper-V, SQL Server, Replication, Availability Group and Analysis Services), Spotlight will monitor the system if able and raise an alarm to let you know the version is not supported. Some collections may fail because Spotlight has not been tested against the version yet. | 3679
