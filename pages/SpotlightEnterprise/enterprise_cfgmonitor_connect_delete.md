Open the Spotlight Client.

1. Click **Configure \| Connections**.
   {% include imageClient.html file="tb_config_connections.png" alt="Configure Connections" %}
2. Right-click on the connection and select **Delete**.

If you have customized the alarms set for this connection or the scheduling information then those customizations will be deleted with the connection. You may like to backup your customizations before you delete the connection. To do so, backup the \Agent\Conf folder in the Spotlight Spotlight Diagnostic Server installation folder.
