The instructions in the Spotlight Enterprise Integration Guide on the PagerDuty web site provide you with the necessary steps: [www.pagerduty.com/docs](https://www.pagerduty.com/docs). PagerDuty is a third party product ([www.pagerduty.com](https://www.pagerduty.com/)).

The Spotlight Diagnostic Server requires Internet access in order to fulfill on [Configure \| Alarm Actions \| Alarm Action \| Send PagerDuty incident][enterprise_cfgmonitor_alarmaction].
