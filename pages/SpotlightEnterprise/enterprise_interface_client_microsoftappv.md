Spotlight supports deploying a global configruation file

```
%ProgramData%\Dell\Spotlight\Default\config.xml
```

which will be copied to the user-specific location on startup of the Spotlight Client.

This is a simple XML file which should be straight-forward to configure for anyone familiar with App-V.
