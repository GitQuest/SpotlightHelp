Data from tracked files is reported on the Windows Server \| Overview Page \| Files Panel. Spotlight raises a File - Exceeded Set Size Alarm when a tracked file approaches the maximum file size set on this page. Spotlight raises a critical alarm when the file exceeds the maximum file size set on this page.
