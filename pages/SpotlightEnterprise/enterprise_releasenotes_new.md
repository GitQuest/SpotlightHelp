## SQL Server \| Workload Analysis drilldown
The SQL Server \| Workload Analysis drilldown has been enhanced with new **Plan** and **SQL** tabs for a selected SQL Statement. The Plan and SQL tabs are of the same design as that for the SQL Activity \| Sessions \| Query Execution Statistics drilldown page.

## Alarms Report
The new Alarms Report can sort and filter alarms by name, severity and change in status. You can also specify the connection(s) to report on.

## Configure Planned Outages
Windows Powershell / the command line can now be used to schedule planned outages.

## SQL - Running out of Threads alarm
The new SQL - Running out of Threads alarm is raised when the number of worker threads in use is high compared to the maximum number of worker threads configured.
