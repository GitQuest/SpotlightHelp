## To freeze the first column

When selected the first column will remain visible while you scroll through the columns of the table:

Right-click the grid header and select **Freeze First column**.

## To word-wrap text

By default, Spotlight truncates text that is too long to fit in the space allocated to the column. To allow text to wrap onto multiple lines:

1. Right-click the data content of the grid and select **Properties \| Options**.
2. Select **Allow text to word-wrap onto multiple lines if it is wider than the column**
