## Freeze First Column

Select when you want the first column of the grid to remain visible while you scroll through the columns of the table.

## Allow text to word-wrap onto multiple lines if it is wider than the column

By default, Spotlight truncates text that is too long to fit in the space allocated to the column.

Select **Allow text to word-wrap onto multiple lines if it is wider than the column** to allow text to wrap onto multiple lines.
