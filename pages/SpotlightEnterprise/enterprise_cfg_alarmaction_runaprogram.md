The standard scenario may be:

* for a given connection
* when a specific alarm is raised
* of specific severity (severities)
* run a program

How can this rule be created and maintained in the Alarm Action Editor?



## Creating the rule

1. Click **Configure \| Alarm Actions**.
2. Click **New** to create a new rule.
3. If this rule is related to specific connections
    a. In the list of conditions, tick **The connection is...**
    b. In the rule description click **connections**. Select the connections this rule applies to.
4. If this rule is related to specific alarms
    a.In the list of conditions, tick **The alarm is...**
    b.In the rule description click **alarms**. Select the alarms this rule applies to.
5. If this rule is related to specific severities
    a.In the list of conditions, tick **The alarm severity is...**
    b.In the rule description click Low, Medium or High. Select the severities this rule applies to.
6. In the list of actions to perform, tick Run a program
    a.In the rule description, click (program). This opens the Run a Program Dialog.

TIP: When you use The connection is... condition there are some things to be aware of. For more information, see The Connection isâ€¦.

## Variable conditions - multiple rules

For any given rule, all the actions are taken when all the conditions are met. Any variability requires separate rules.

Following is an example.

For all alarms
where the connection type is one of os/vmware, os/windows
      and the alarm severity is High
   run programA

For all alarms
where the connection type is database/sqlserver
      and the alarm severity is Medium or High
   run programB


## Run a Program Dialog

Configure Spotlight to run a program when an alarm is raised.

## To open this dialog

1. Click Configure \| Alarms Actions to open the Configure \| Alarm Actions.
2. Click **New** to create a new rule. This opens the Alarm Action Dialog.
   a.Give a meaningful name to the rule.
   b.Select the conditions under which the rule will run.
   c.Under actions select **Run a program**.


## The Run a program dialog

Enter the command to run the program at the Command line prompt.

You can include variable values specific to the alarm in the command line. See Alarms - Message Variables for more information. For example you can echo tag values as follows.

Output to file | echo {{TAG_VALUE #tagname}} >>c:\output.txt
Output to monitor | MSG /SERVER:<computer name> * "{{TAG_VALUE #tagname}}"

   Note: The behavior of the invoked program depends on the nature of the program.
* It is recommended that you do not invoke a UI-based program in response to the alarm, as the program will run as a service on a remote host.
* If the program that runs in response to an alarm is still executing when the alarm fires again, subsequent commands to run the program are ignored until that execution finishes.
* If you attempt to stop the Spotlight on SQL Server whilst a program or command line action is still executing, the Spotlight on SQL Server will wait until that program or command line action has ended before stopping.
