The standard scenario may be:

* for a given connection
* when a specific alarm is raised
* of specific severity ([severities][enterprise_cfgmonitor_alarm_severity])
* send an email

How can this rule be created and maintained?



## Create and maintain alarm action rules from the Spotlight Client

From the Spotlight Client:

1. Click [Configure \| Alarms Actions][enterprise_cfgmonitor_alarmactions].
2. Click **New** to create a new rule. This opens the [Alarm Action Dialog][enterprise_cfgmonitor_alarmaction].

## Select the conditions under which the rule will run.


If this rule is related to specific connections

1. In the list of conditions, tick **The connection is...**
2. In the rule description click **connections**. Select the connections this rule applies to.

   {% include tip.html content="When you use The **connection is...** condition there are some things to be aware of. For more information, see [The Connection isâ€¦][enterprise_cfgmonitor_alarmaction_connectionis]." %}

If this rule is related to specific alarms

1. In the list of conditions, tick **The alarm is...**
2. In the rule description click alarms. Select the alarms this rule applies to.

If this rule is related to specific severities

1. In the list of conditions, tick **The alarm severity is...**
2. In the rule description click Low, Medium or High. Select the severities this rule applies to.

### Variable conditions - multiple rules

For any given rule, all the actions are taken when all the conditions are met. Any variability requires separate rules.

You may want to direct operating system related alarms to the help desk and SQL Server related alarms to the DBA group.
