## Variable conditions - multiple rules

For any given rule, all the actions are taken when all the conditions are met. Any variability requires separate rules.

You may want to direct operating system related alarms to the help desk and SQL Server related alarms to the DBA group.

{% raw %}

For all alarms
where the connection type is one of os/vmware, os/windows
   send email to helpdesk@company com
