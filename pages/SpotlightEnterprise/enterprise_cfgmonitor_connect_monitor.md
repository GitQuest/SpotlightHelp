3. Select monitoring options

Note: The visibility of some of these options is dependent on connection type.

## Monitor this server

Selected | Monitor this connection.
Not Selected | Do not monitor this connection. No new data is collected and therefore no alarms are raised. Existing data in the Playback Database and Spotlight Statistics Repository is preserved.
