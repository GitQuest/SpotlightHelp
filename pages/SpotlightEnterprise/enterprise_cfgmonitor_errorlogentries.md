## How Spotlight treats matched error log entries

Matched entries raise the **Error Log - Error Count alarm** on the SQL Server \| Overview Page \| Background Processes panel \| Error Log button. More information on the matched entry is available from the [SQL Server \| Error Log drilldown][sqlserver_drilldown_errorlog].

{% include note.html content="Spotlight scans the error logs at the configured frequency. If you make changes to the alert rules it may take some time for changes to take effect. You can change the frequency via [Configure \| Scheduling][enterprise_cfgmonitor_scheduling]." %}


## Configure error log entries from the Spotlight Client

Click {% include inline_imageClient.html file="tb_config_errorlogentries.png" alt="Configure Error Log Entries" %} **Configure \| Error Log Entries**.

{% include tip.html content="To open this screen with a connection pre-selected, from the SQL Server \| Overview page click **Error Log**, or from the SQL Server \| Error Log drilldown click **Error Log Entries**." %}

## Select template or connection to configure

Select the SQL Server connection from the list of available options. Spotlight will show the configuration for that connection. Make changes if required. Optionally use the options at the bottom of the screen to apply the same configuration to other SQL Server connections or save the configuration as a template.

Alternatively, select a template to configure. The templates you have previously saved for Spotlight Error Log Entries configuration are listed. On selecting the template you can view / modify / reapply the template configuration. You can delete or rename the template. For more information, see [Configuration templates][enterprise_cfgmonitor_templates].

### Use factory settings

Clear the **Override the factory settings** option to return the settings for the selected template or connection to the Factory Settings. These are the settings that were shipped with Spotlight.
