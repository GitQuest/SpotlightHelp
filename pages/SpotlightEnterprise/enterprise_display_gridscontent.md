## Restore default settings

To restore the default order to the column headings and word-wrapping settings:

1. Right-click on the data in the chart or grid.
2. Select **Restore Default Settings**.
3. Click **Restore**.


## Tree view

If available, this provides for the option of displaying the left most column of the Spotlight grid as a hierarchical tree structure. Use this icon to toggle between a simple text string list and the hierarchical tree structure.

The first column in a Spotlight grid may show data as a simple text string or (if available) a hierarchical tree structure. If the data can be shown in both formats, you can choose which view to use.

To show or hide trees in tables

Toggle tree view on/off

The images below show the same first column of a table in the two different formats.

 {% include inline_imageClient.html file="pane_grid_treeno.png" alt="Sample Grid no Tree" %}
 {% include inline_imageClient.html file="pane_grid_tree.png" alt="Sample Tree" %}

{% include note.html content="When you sort a table in tree view, the table is sorted first according to the highest level in the tree; the individual branches and sub-branches of the tree are sorted separately in the same order." %}



## Properties

### To freeze the first column

When selected the first column will remain visible while you scroll through the columns of the table:

Right-click the grid header and select Freeze First column.

### To word-wrap text

By default, Spotlight truncates text that is too long to fit in the space allocated to the column. To allow text to wrap onto multiple lines:

1. Right-click the data content of the grid and select **Properties \| Options**.
2. Select **Allow text to word-wrap onto multiple lines if it is wider than the column**


## Uable to collect data

{% include imageClient.html file="icon_refresherror.png" alt="Refresh Error" %}

If Spotlight is unable to collect the data required, Spotlight displays a small icon on the affected component. Click the icon to see more information about the problem.
