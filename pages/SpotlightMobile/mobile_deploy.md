## Spotlight Enterprise components and Spotlight Mobile

A minimal Spotlight Enterprise deployment consists of a Spotlight Client (to customize Spotlight and view data from monitored systems), a Spotlight Diagnostic Server (to collect data from monitored systems) and a Playback Database (to store recent history). These components are installed with Spotlight Enterprise.

### Spotlight Client

A Spotlight Client is used to configure Spotlight. For example, a Spotlight Client is used to add and remove the connections monitored through Spotlight. This cannot be done in Spotlight Mobile.

### Spotlight Diagnostic Server

The Spotlight Diagnostic Server collects data from monitored systems. A prerequisite to using Spotlight Mobile is

* The Spotlight Diagnostic Server is configured to upload data to the Spotlight Cloud.
* The Spotlight Diagnostic Server has access to the Internet.
* Port TCP 443 on the Spotlight Diagnostic Server is open.

### Spotlight Playback Database

Recent history is stored in the Playback Database. The Playback Database is deployed on SQL Server. Each Spotlight Diagnostic Server requires its own Playback Database. A Spotlight Client is used to configure the Spotlight Playback Database.

### Spotlight Statistics Repository

Long term history for reporting and trending is stored in the Spotlight Statistics Repository. The Spotlight Statistics Repository is inaccessible to Spotlight Mobile.

### Spotlight Cloud

Spotlight Cloud Health Performance data is uploaded to the Spotlight web site. This data is accessible only from the Spotlight web site.
