Page Files are disk files that the Windows Virtual Memory Manager uses to back up physical memory. Code and data is moved between physical memory and the page files as required, giving processes on the system the illusion that there is much more physical memory available than there really is. The process of moving data and code between memory and disk is called paging.

It shows:

* Page File **location** (file name).
* The page file **size (MB)**.
* The current **used (MB)** space in the page file.
* The current amount of **free (MB)** space in the page file.
* The current **used** space as a **percentage** of the page file size.
* The **peak** percentage of space used in the specified page file.
