## To rectify the problem of the logical disk space filling up:

* Inform users of the disk volume to clean up space by deleting or moving files no longer required.
* Delete files that are no longer required from the volume.
* Move files to a volume with spare space.
* Purchase more disk capacity for the system, and move data onto it.

It is recommended that you make a backup of the system before moving or deleting any files.

{% include note.html content="This problem can be raised by the Disks - Percentage Used alarm where thresholds are set on the percentage of disk space used, or the Disks - Free Space alarm where thresholds are set on available megabytes free. By default the Disks - Percentage Used alarm is enabled and the Disks - Free Space alarm is disabled." %}
