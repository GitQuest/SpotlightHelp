A page fault occurs when a process requires code or data that is not in its space in physical memory.

A soft fault occurs when a memory page is not in the physical memory of the process, but resides in another segment of physical memory.

A hard fault occurs when a memory page is not in the physical memory of the process, and has to be brought from disk.
