### Overhead %

Percentage of CPU that is being consumed by other virtual machines or by VMware itself.

### Idle %

Percentage of CPU that is idle.

### Used %

Percentage of CPU being used by this virtual machine.

## Values

A low idle percentage indicates that the virtual machine may not be getting the CPU time it requires. This can be seen in the chart when the overhead and used percentages meet.
