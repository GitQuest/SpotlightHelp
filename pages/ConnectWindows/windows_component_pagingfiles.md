The disk icon "fills up" as the total percentage of all paging files used increases. This is the total amount of space used by paging files as a percentage of the maximum size of all paging files.

The disk icon also shows:

* The total size of all paging files on all disks in the system.
* The current amount of space being used by all paging files on all disks in the system.
