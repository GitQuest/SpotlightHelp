## Logical Processor Total Runtime

A logical processor is an actual CPU on the Hyper-V server.

## Virtual Processor Total Runtime

A virtual processor is the Hyper-V equivalent of a processor for a virtual machine. Items assigned to a virtual processor run on a logical processor, but not necessarily the same logical processor each time.

A logical processor executes items for many virtual processors. All items to be executed are placed in a queue and the logical processor executes all that is queued.
