If there are multiple network cards, right-click the gauge and select **Select network card** to choose which one you want to display on the Spotlight Overview page.

Alarms can be raised in this panel for all network cards in the machine, not only the card displayed.

Because of the methods involved in sending data, the actual maximum on an Ethernet network usually is approximately 50% of the theoretical bandwidth.  The actual bandwidth can equal the theoretical bandwidth only when using full duplex Ethernet.

Token-passing network topologies (including **Token Ring** and **FDDI**) enable a theoretical maximum bandwidth much closer to the actual.
