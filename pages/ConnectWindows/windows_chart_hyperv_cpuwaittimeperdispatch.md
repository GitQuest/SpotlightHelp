The average queue time should remain under 60,000ns. If the average queue time exceeds 60,000ns then an alarm is raised. A high alarm is raised if the average queue time exceeds 100,000ns.

The current metric value is displayed on the Windows Server \| Spotlight Overview page \| Virtualization Overhead control.
