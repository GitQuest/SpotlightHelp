This can cause performance degradation â€“  especially on IDE disks. IDE disks allow only a single disk operation  to be active on the bus at any time.

## To rectify this:

1. Open the Windows  Control Panel.
2. Double-click **System**.
3. Click the **Advanced** tab.
4. Select **Performance Settings**, and change the  paging file allocations.
