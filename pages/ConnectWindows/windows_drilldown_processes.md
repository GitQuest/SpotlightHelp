### Process details

Investigate detailed information about a running process.

### Process history

Investigate recent activity of a process.

#### Processor Utilization chart
Shows the percentage of Privileged and User Time.

High Privileged time means that the program is predominantly busy accessing resources through operating system requests.

High User time means that the program is predominantly CPU-bound with the program code itself.

#### Read/Writes chart
Reads / Second - Shows the number of IO reads (such as hard disk reads and memory reads) being performed by the process.

Writes / Second - Shows the number of IO writes (such as hard disk writes and memory writes) being performed by the process.

#### Memory Usage chart
Shows the current memory allocated to the selected process.

Memory Usage shows the current size of the working set of the selected process. The working set is the set of memory pages touched recently by the threads in the process.

Virtual Memory Size shows the current size of the memory allocated to this process that cannot be shared with other processes.

#### Page Faults chart
Shows the number of page faults being generated by the program. A consistently high value may indicate a lack of memory. However, this collection includes both soft and hard page faults; as such, there may be no associated problems.


### Process threads

Investigate threads executed by a process.

##### Process Threads grid
Shows current information about the threads executed by the selected process.


## Services page
