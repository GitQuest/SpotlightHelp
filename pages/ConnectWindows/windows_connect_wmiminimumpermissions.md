## Known Issues

### The OpenSessions collection

The OpenSessions collection sends a list of the open Windows network sessions to your server. The list includes who is connected and from where, how long they have been connected and how many files they have open.

The OpenSessions collection is used in:

* The Windows Server \| Spotlight Overview page \| Network Panel \| Open Sessions count.
* The Windows Server \| Network Drilldown \| Sessions page.

Spotlight does not alarm on this data.

### The Physical Disk Drive collection

The Physical Disk Drive collection populates the Windows Server \| Disks Drilldown \| Disk Summary page. This drilldown contains a list of the physical disks installed on the server. Its data is relatively static as it only changes when disks are added, removed or repartitioned.

Inside of this known issue a Generic Failure error will be returned.


## 1. Setup permission to read data

{% include note.html content="For the following instructions, Spotlight User is the windows user that will be used to authenticate the Spotight connection to the Windows server as per: [Connection Details][windows_connect_details]" %}

1. Click Control Panel \| Administrative Tools \| Computer Management to open the Computer Management dialog.
2. Double click Local Users and Groups \| Groups.
3. Double click Performance Log Users. Add the Spotlight User to this group. OK.
4. Double click Performance Monitor Users. Add the Spotlight User to this group. OK.


## 2. Grant permissions to get information about services

### Retrieve the user SID

From the Windows command prompt, type powershell and click Enter to open the Powershell.

Run the following command to retrieve the user SID of the Spotlight User. Replace domainName and userName with the domain name and user name for the Spotlight User account.

```
[wmi]"win32_useraccount.domain='domainName',name='userName'"
```

### Retrieve the current SDDL for the Services Control Manager

From the Windows command prompt, run the following command to retrieve the current SDDL for the Services Control Manager. The SDDL is saved in the file called file.txt.

```
sc sdshow scmanager > file.txt
```

The SDDL looks something like this. For more information see Microsoft KB914392.

```
D:(A;;CC;;;AU)(A;;CCLCRPRC;;;IU)(A;;CCLCRPRC;;;SU)(A;;CCLCRPWPRC;;;SY)(A;;KA;;;BA)S:(AU;FA;KA;;;WD)(AU;OIIOFA;GA;;;WD)
```

### Modify the SDDL

Copy the section of the SDDL that ends in IU (Interactive Users). This section is one complete bracketed clause ie (A;;CCLCRPRC;;;IU). Paste this clause directly after the clause you copied from.

In the new text, replace IU with the user SID of the Spotlight User.

The new SDDL looks something like the following:

```
D:(A;;CC;;;AU)(A;;CCLCRPRC;;;IU) (A;;CCLCRPRC;;;S-1-5-21-214A909598-1293495619-13Z157935-75714)(A;;CCLCRPRC;;;SU)(A;;CCLCRPWPRC;;;SY)(A;;KA;;;BA) S:(AU;FA;KA;;;WD)(AU;OIIOFA;GA;;;WD)
```

### Set the security credentials for accessing the Service Control Manager

The sdset command on sc sets the security credentials for accessing the Service Control Manager (scmanager). Note the permissions on scmanager are being replaced. Setting security credentials is not additive. Thatâ€™s why we needed to copy the existing permissions.

```
sc sdset scmanager "D:(A;;CC;;;AU)(A;;CCLCRPRC;;;IU)(A;;CCLCRPRC;;;SU)(A;;CCLCRPWPRC;;;SY)(A;;KA;;;BA)(A;;CCLCRPRC;;;S-1-5-21-214A909598-1293495619-13Z157935-75714)S:(AU;FA;KA;;;WD)(AU;OIIOFA;GA;;;WD)"
```
