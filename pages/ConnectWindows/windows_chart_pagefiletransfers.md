The **Page reads** value shows the number of times the disk was read to resolve hard page faults.

The **Page writes** value shows the number of times pages were written to disk to free up space in physical memory.

Paging occurs when the Windows Virtual Memory Manager moves data or code between physical memory and disk. Sustained high paging rates can degrade system performance significantly.
